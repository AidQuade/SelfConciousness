   This github will serve as the blog and progress updates for the top down shoot em up game I am working on.

  # Progress 1 Brainstorming and concept
      First I settled on the concept of a top down shooter game with the core mechanic of "Switching" between the playable character, making the enemies playable as well. The switching will serve as a way to reset health, use different weapons or take advantage of the enemies attributes like higher health, speed and specific more complex attributes later in the game. I formulated a plan to execute this game within 8 weeks and hope to have a working playable demo with a few levels by then.
      
   # Progress 2 Initial top down shooter setup.
        This second week I did not get as far as I would have liked on the core switching mechanics and instead just focused on making a working top down shooter base with enemies that have AI to roam randomly, target the player within range and stop or retreat based on the distance of the player. There is no technical single "player" character as any character that is attacking the player needs to also have the ability to be switched into and thus toggle off their state as an AI and give control to the player.
